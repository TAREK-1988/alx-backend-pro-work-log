# 🚀 ALX ProDev Backend — Monthly Work Log (November 2025)

## 📘 Summary of What I Worked On
This month, I focused on improving my backend development skills through the **ALX ProDev Back-End track**.  
I completed several key projects involving database optimization, Python generators, and decorators.  
I also practiced advanced concepts like **transaction management**, **error handling**, and **query performance tuning**.

## 🏆 Achievements
- Completed the **Database Performance Monitoring** project successfully.  
- Built clean, efficient solutions using **Python Decorators** to manage database queries, retries, and caching.  
- Integrated my work on GitHub with consistent commits and organized directories.  
- Improved my understanding of **scalable backend design patterns**.

## 💡 Learnings from Challenges
- Faced several syntax and logic errors while handling **SQLite connections and decorators**, but debugging taught me how to better handle transactions and exceptions.  
- Learned the importance of proper **code structure and readability** when working on multiple tasks in sequence.  
- Realized that decorators can drastically reduce repetitive code and make backend logic cleaner.

## 🌟 Monthly Highlights
- Completed all backend projects for the month on time.  
- Improved my confidence working with **context managers** and **asynchronous programming** in Python.  
- Shared my progress with peers on Discord and GitHub.  
- Continued building my professional portfolio under the **ALX SE Program**.
